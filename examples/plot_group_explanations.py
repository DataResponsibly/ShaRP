Comparison of feature contributions for advantaged and disadvantaged groups
===========================================================================

This example demonstrates how feature contributions differ for advantaged and
disadvantaged groups after training ``ShaRP`` model on the whole data.

# Let's start with data preparation. For this example, we chose The ACSIncome dataset which
# is one of five datasets created by Ding et al. as an improved alternative to the
# popular UCI Adult dataset. Data is provided for all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Its initial
# purpose was to predict whether US working adultsâ€™ yearly income is above $50,000.
# The features are the following:
# - AGEP: age
# - COW: class of worker
# - SCHL: educational attainment
# - MAR: marital status
# - OCCP: occupation
# - POBP: place of birth
# - RELP: relationship
# - WKHP: usual hours worked per week
# - SEX: sex
# - RAC1P: recoded detailed race code

    data_id=43141, parser="auto", return_X_y=True, read_csv_kwargs={"nrows": 150}
)

# Get the indices of samples that belong to each group. 
# We will use SEX as sensitive attribute
adv_idx = X[X["SEX"] == 1].index
dis_idx = X[X["SEX"] == 2].index

# Reduce the number of features in the dataset
numerical_cols = ["AGEP", "WKHP"]
ordinal_cols = ["SCHL"]

X = X.filter(items=numerical_cols + ordinal_cols)

# Here we will define the scoring function
def score_function(X):
    X, _ = check_inputs(X)

# Standardize X and calculate scores
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X.iloc[:, :] = scaler.fit_transform(X)
scores = score_function(X)

# Next, we will configure ``ShaRP`` and fit it on the whole dataset:

xai = ShaRP(
    qoi="rank",
    target_function=score_function,
    measure="shapley",
    sample_size=None,
    replace=False,
    random_state=42,
    n_jobs=-1,
)

xai.fit(X)


#########################################################################################
# Let's compute contributions for the whole dataset

contributions = xai.all(X)

# Now let's create box plots and compare feature contributions for privileged and
# protected groups

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, sharey=True, figsize=(15, 5))

for ax, idx, title in zip(
    axes.flatten(),
    [X.index, adv_idx, dis_idx],
    ["All", "Advantaged group", "Disadvantaged group"],
):
    xai.plot.box(X=X.loc[idx], y=scores[idx], contributions=contributions[idx], ax=ax)
    ax.set_xlabel(title)

plt.show()


#########################################################################################
# On the plots, feature contributions are shown across different strata, e.g., for 
# top-20% of ranked individuals, for the whole dataset (i.e., `All`), and both advantaged 
# and disadvantaged groups. For the advantaged group, age (AGEP) exhibits stable 
# importance across all strata, while the contributions of worked hours (WKHP) and 
# educational attainment (SCHL) increase as we move toward lower-ranked individuals. 
# Conversely, for the disadvantaged group, the importance of `AGEP` decreases with lower 
# ranks, while `WKHP` and `SCHL` remain relatively stable.


#########################################################################################
# We can also compare contributions across groups overall:

X["Sex"] = ""
X.loc[adv_idx, "Sex"] = "Male"
X.loc[dis_idx, "Sex"] = "Female"
xai.plot.box(X, scores, contributions, group="Sex")
plt.show()

# We can see that for males, the importance of `WKHP` is lower compared to females, while
# `AGEP` shows also a positive contribution to the outcomes, indicating that older 
# individuals are more likely to achieve favorable results.
